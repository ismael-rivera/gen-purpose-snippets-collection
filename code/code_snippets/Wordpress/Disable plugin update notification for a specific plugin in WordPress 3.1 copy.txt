//Disable plugin update notification for a specific plugin in WordPress 3.1

/*REMOVE OR DISABLE UPDATE FUNCTION FROM A SPECIFIC PLUGIN
Just  quick sniplet of code to drop into a plugin file to disable plugin update notifications.

The reason i’ve written this is a plugin which has been heavily modified has a update, and, wanted to stop hearing about it; Sure, I could’ve just changed the name, but this felt more Politically Correct (and isn’t that what we’re all supposed to do!?)

So, The code:
*/

add_filter('site_transient_update_plugins', 'dd_remove_update_nag');
function dd_remove_update_nag($value) {
 unset($value->response[ plugin_basename(__FILE__) ]);
 return $value;
}

Hello, it seems like a simple solution blocking pluin update notifications. Question: Where exactly do I drop the above mentioned code? In its own little file that I put in the main directory of the plugin itself? Please advise. Thank you.

just copy and paste that code in the main .php file of the plugin in question, I don’t think location matters as long as it is within PHP tags.

How to: Embed CSS in your posts with a custom field

Sometimes, a specific post needs to be styled with some custom css styles. Sure, you can directly embed CSS in your post, but that not very clean. In this recipe, Iâ€™m going to show you how to embed css in a clean way, by using a custom field.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, open your header.php file and insert the following code between the <head> and </head> html tags:

<?php if (is_single()) {
    $css = get_post_meta($post->ID, 'css', true);
    if (!empty($css)) { ?>
        <style type="text/css">
        <?php echo $css; ?>   
        </style>
    <?php } 
} ?>

Once done, when you're writing a post or page which require some custom css styling, you'll just have to create a custom field named css and paste your custom css styles as a value. That's simple as that!

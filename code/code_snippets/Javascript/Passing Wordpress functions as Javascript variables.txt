You could avoid hardcoding the full path by setting a JS variable in the header of your template, before wp_head() is called, holding the template URL. Like:

<script type="text/javascript">
var templateUrl = '<?= get_bloginfo("template_url"); ?>';
var pluginsUrl = '<?= plugins_url(); ?>';
</script>

And use that variable to set the background (I realize you know how to do this, I only include these details in case they helps others):

Reset.style.background = " url('"+templateUrl+"/images/searchfield_clear.png') ";

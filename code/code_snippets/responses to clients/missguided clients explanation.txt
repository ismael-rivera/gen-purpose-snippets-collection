I gave you a design that was easy for accessing all pages and made it accessible to anyone who has never been to this site before. As someone who has experience in designing websites I gave you a good design with a navigation system that a baby could follow. Unfortunately, like a lot of missguided clients, you decided to go against it in favor of your own design. I don't have the time to convince you otherwise and I know good and well enough that the only way people learn is by making the mistake. You wanted my advice, I gave it to you and you still another way. I'm sorry but it is not my fault that the website navigates the way it does. Up to this point I have only been following your instructions.

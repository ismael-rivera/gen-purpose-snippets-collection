----------IN THIS EXAMPLE THE MYSQL TABLE HAS AN ID COLUMN WITH AUTO-INCREMENT. THE CSV FILE, HOWEVER, DOES NOT HAVE AN ID COLUMN. GENERALLY, COLUMNS WITH AUTO-INCREMENT SHOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM THE SQL COMMAND IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE PARSER TO CLASSIFY ALL ID'S AS NULL THEREBY REPLACING THEM WITH THE NEW ID'S OF THE TABLE.

LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '/workbook1.csv'
INTO TABLE `project_categories`
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
ENCLOSED BY '"' 
ESCAPED BY '\\' 
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
(`job_type`);
